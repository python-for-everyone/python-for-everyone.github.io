# Other string methods

# methods join,split,lower and upper ()

# Imagine that we have a list with names and unique id's of all employees in your company.

# The list looks like this:

list_of_employees_and_ids = ['Linus','23','Kevin','24','Emiliano','25']


# join

# Now you want to join the the names with the unique id's together to create usernames for the new system.

# The elements that were separated by commas before were now joined together with underscores.

print("_".join(list_of_employees_and_ids)) # I joined them together with an underscore.

# Now you can copy the name with respective unique id number.


# split

# If you now want to split a string, then you can use the split method ().

random_string = "I love food"

print (random_string.split(" "))

# You can see that the string was split based on the whitespaces in the random_string variable.


# lower

# if you want to convert a string into small letters, then you can use the method lower ()

string = 'HIGH'

print(string.lower()) #every letter in string is now small --> string = "high".

#upper

# if you want to capitalize all letters in your string, then you can use the method upper ()

string_new = 'low'

print(string_new.upper()) #the letters in string_new are now all capitalized.

# Cool tricks when working with strings

# You can comment out several lines of code with """ """

""" This will not be read by the interpreter.
    I am able to write several lines of code
    with this beautiful method. """

# With double quotation marks you can solve the problem of adding an apostrophe 's to a word.

print ("This is Kevin's computer")

# If I wouldn't add double quotation marks, then Python would throw an error!

# print ('This is Kevin's computer') #Comment it in to see the effect.
